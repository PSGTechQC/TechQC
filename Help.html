                Even though we know that Ragging is strictly prohibited in our college, we want everyone to know that abusing physically or mentally based on gender (includes transgender) or sexual orientation should be prohibited under the act of UGC, 1956.

                Let's spread loveðŸ¥° and don't judge people around based on their sexuality, it's natural if you didn't know already.

               Students who are brave enough to figure out their sexuality and coming out should be celebratedðŸ¥³ not to be judged. 
                Let's create a safe and comfortable spaceðŸ¤— here in PSG tech for whoever is brave and nurture the ones who are still Closeted. <br>
