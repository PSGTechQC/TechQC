            <h1 class="mt_2">TechQC towards LGBTQIA:</h1>
            <p>
                <span>W</span>e are aware of SLAVERY, MALE DOMINATION, WHITES vs BLACKS, CASTE SYSTEM and other unhuman philosophies and discriminations. So is the homophobia. People organized and protested against these and we are progressing. Yes the LGBTQ community is vulnerable and needs to be acknowledged. As women’s rights can not be implemented without the cooperation of men, LGBTQ community can not express themselves, and live in peace and harmony without the support of the heterosexual people. We know that this is a sensitive issue as it involves dignity and rights even to discuss about it. We are concerned about it and some of us decided to make PSG College of Technology, a discrimination free campus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Are you a girl, attracted towards girls/a boy, attracted towards boys/girl or boy, attracted towards both ? TechQC provides you a safe space to discover and express more about yourselves, to tell others that we are not vulnerable and isolated, to help those individuals who have faced intimidation or harassment or discrimination due to their sexual orientation. We are not meant to be insulted, isolated, bullied, or excluded. Come, talk, discuss and connect with us freely.
            </p>
            <h1>TechQC towards sexual assault:</h1>
            <p>
                <span>W</span>e have heard about crime incidents against women. Some blame the law and some may blame the society, culture, religion and so on. According to us these kinds of incidents are initiated among the public as lack of proper education, awareness and even self control for that matter. This is exclusive of gender. We know about men who are also being affected by sexual assaults on a daily basis. Even age will not be a matter as we all know. The mentality of men to use women as mere objects has to go. To be more appropriate, the mentality of a human to think their FELLOW HUMANS as mere objects has to end. TechQC is here to make you feel less vulnerable if you think you are. Remember that, every member of TechQC is not a victim of this but in some way related to it. The prime motive of TechQC is to abolish these kinds of harm, but we focus more on helping the victims rather than fighting against those sinners. Make sure that you remember TechQC whenever you or your loved ones are out there, feeling uncomfortable dealing with this.
            </p>
            <h1>Why TechQC ?</h1>
            <p>
                <span>T</span>he students who are a part of TechQC now are in some way connected to sexual molestation.
                We, the background of TechQC decided that this should end somewhere and awareness should spread regarding gender discrimination.
                Someone bullying you? Or sexually harassing/harassed you? But you can’t approach authority because of the fear of losing your identity? Have doubts about the phase you are going through? Or wanna know more about these things to support us?
            </p>
            <p>
                Please connect with us. And we promise that your identity will be anonymous until you want it to be.
                TN has had a conservative culture and mindset towards LGBTQ+. PSG Tech being located at Coimbatore is also conservative in the same way. Terms like Homosexuality, LGBTQ & Sexual Harassment all are considered taboo. It deters people from being themselves and also causes mental stress in some cases – which is why we need TechQC to create awareness and to provide a safe space for our fellow queer folks. Only limited campuses like IITM, SRM, and Pondicherry university have support groups of this kind in TN.
            </p>
            <p>
                TechQC is a small step towards a more inclusive society, that does not judge people based on their gender and sexuality.
